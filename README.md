# CS1530 Final Project

#### Overview
For our final project we created a financial tracking app. For our two features we did a simple implementation of an expense tracker and a budget creator. We mocked a lot of the functionality that would otherwise take more time to complete. For example, instead of an expense tracker getting data from a user's bank account activity, the user can enter their own expenses.

#### Starting the system
To run the website, open `doc.html` on a locally hosted web broswer. All of our storage and database functinality is also mocked so that everything can be run locally and all data can be stored locally.

#### Unit Test
To run the unit test, type `npm test` in the command line of a terminal that contains the test file
